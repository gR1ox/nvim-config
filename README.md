This is my personal neovim configuaration
It is currently setup for java development

To be setup properly is C# development

At this moment October 2025, i have not been using neovim (or vim motions for that matter)
for so long, so i am still getting used to it, most of my .lua files are simply copypasted and configured a little by me
others are made and helped by from ChatGPT (It all seems to be working), i will try to push, when i make big changes
I simply have this repo, to make it easier for me to move between my machines (I usually work on my macbook, but also have a windows desktop and a linux laptop)
